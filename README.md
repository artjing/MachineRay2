# MachineRay 2

I gathered images of abstract paintings from WikiArt.org, processed them, and fed them into StyleGAN2 ADA at the size of 1024x1024. I first trained the GAN using landscape photos for four days. Next, I trained the GAN for four days using abstract paintings. I then processed the output images by adjusting the aspect ratio.
